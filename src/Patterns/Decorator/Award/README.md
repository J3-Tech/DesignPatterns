# Question
In Elizabeth's daycare center, there are many reward programs for the kids each week.  For example: three types of awards are given to kids for their achievements at the end of each week.  Depending on how the kids perform each week, the kids could have different prizes:

1. All the kids will have sticker at the end of the week as a prize.
2. A kid could have a certificate posted on his/her cubicle if the kid passed potty training.
3. The kid could also have a free book when she/he becomes the kid of the week.

Remember, kids may have different prizes at the end of each week.  It really depends on what the kid has done that week.  That means the awards are dynamically added to the kids every week, and they can also be removed the next week.

1. Identity design pattern(s) that can be used to solve this problem.
2. Create class/collaboration diagrams to represent a possible solution.
3. Implement the solution in PHP.
