Write a program suppose, it is required to build a project consisting of a number of classes, possibly using a large number of programmers. It is necessary to make sure that every class from which all other classes in the project will be inherited. Since any new classes in the project must inherit from the base class, programmers are not free to create a different interface. Therefore, it can be guaranteed that all the classes in the project will respond to the same debugging commands.
